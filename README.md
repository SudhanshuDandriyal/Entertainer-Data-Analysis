Hello all. We are the team of 4 members -

We have completed the Project "Entertainer Data Analysis" provided by iNeuron.

In this Project, we were provided with a dataset named 'Entertainment Data Analysis' in MS Excel File. There were totally 3 MS Excel File consisting total of 8 columns. We merged all 3 Excel files into a single Excel File, named it as "Entertainer Data Analysis" and also added 12 more columns from our side.

We used PowerBI Desktop version to create and visualize charts and getting insights from those charts.

We also used RStudio to study relationship between Prestigious Awards won for breakthrough and Ratings given for the breakthrough.

After rigorous analysis, we got insights from data and all analysis are put in Detail Project Report.

All required documents are uploaded.

Thanks to iNeuron for providing us with this wonderful opportunity.
